- Don't delete console.log that I added.
- Do not ever use `any`. If you feel like you have to use `any`, use `unknown` instead.
- Use `Boolean()` if you need to force a boolean value instead of using `!!`.
- Sort imports alphabetically.
- Ensure member imports are sorted alphabetically. (e.g., `import { A, B, C } from "mod";`)
