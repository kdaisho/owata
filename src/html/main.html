<div class="home">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>welcome to owata!</h2>
    <p>your private, encrypted bookmarking tool.</p>
  </hgroup>

  <p>
    how it works:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      enter a website URL into the input field.
    </li>
    <li>
      hit "add" to include it in your bookmark list.
    </li>
    <li>
      repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the URLs you want to save.
    </li>
    <li>
      when you're done, hit "encrypt"
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    owata will encrypt your list of URLs and provide you with a ciphered text.
    copy the ciphered text and store it securely. (owata doesn't save anything
    for you!)
  </p>
  <p>
    when you return, paste the ciphered text to decrypt it and view your secret
    bookmark list. Owata keeps your bookmarks secure, private, and in your
    control!
  </p>
